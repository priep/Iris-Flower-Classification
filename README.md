# Iris-Flower-Classification Project
#This project classifies different species of Iris flowers using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, and Matplotlib. By analyzing the famous Iris dataset, the project visualizes patterns in flower dimensions and applies classification techniques to distinguish between species. It's a hands-on demonstration of data visualization and basic machine learning in Python.
