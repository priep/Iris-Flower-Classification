# Iris-Flower-Classification Project
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of learning from the measurements of iris flowers and accurately classifying them into their respective species. The model's primary goal is to automate the classification process based on the distinct characteristics of each iris species.

**Project Description:**
The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on specific measurements. Iris flowers are classified into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, each of which exhibits distinct characteristics in terms of measurements.
The model aims to automate the classification process, offering a practical solution for identifying iris species.

**Key Project Details**
1. Iris flowers have three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
2. These species can be distinguished based on measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
3. The project involves training a machine learning model on a dataset that contains iris flower measurements associated with their respective species.
4. The trained model will classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements.
